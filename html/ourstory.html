      <h1>Covid-19 Response</h1>
    </div>
      <div class="covid_19_text">
        <p>The covid-19 pandemic has affected all of us in very different ways. While we haven't been able to help abroad because 
          of travel restrictions, we've been helping in many other ways during the pandemic. Cypress Missions has taken a much needed 
          look at our own local communities to see where we can lend a hand to help. Labtops have been in dire need for online schooling 
          and we have seen the struggle to get them so we took action to get chrome books out to kids for online learning. It is imperative 
          that kids can continue their education. We are also completing local projects around our communities in Neptune, NJ  and Asbury park, NJ. 
          Covid has been rough for all over us but we will continue to do our part in helping where possible. Thank you for all your support. We will 
          continue to update you all with more projects in the local communities and let you know when we are able to continue our partner ship projects.</p>

    <h2>Cypress Missions</h2>
    <p>We are recently formed, but our roots run deep. For over 25 years, Freddie has led teams of people
       on work-oriented trips throughout North America. Cypress Missions is devoted to mobilizing short-term 
       mission trips that directly impact the recovery efforts of communities in need following natural disasters. 
       We connect teams and resources to rebuild distressed and impoverished areas. Cypress missions has brought 
       resources, repaired many different structures to bring healthy quality of life back to poverty stricken 
       communities and devastated communities from natural disasters.</p>

          <h2>The Goal</h2>
          <p>Our goal is to encourage the leaders of the communities we help to reach out to others in need while serving 
              as a base for the community. We try to help give better directive, pursuance, confidence and a plan to help.</p>

          <h2>In The News</h2>
          <p>Cypress Missions is proud to be one of the many American non-profits mentioned by NBC News for helping the resilient
             community on Green Turtle, Bahamas which was devastated by Hurricane Dorian.</p>

        <h2>Outreach</h2>
        <p>It's very simple for me. I don't have a “we and they” mentality. My youth groups were always 
            wide open. When they walked in the doors, there was no doubt they were accepted for who they 
            were but challenged to be more. This same philosophy applies to mission trips. We are no better 
            or worse than those we go to help. You teach compassion and empathy by experiencing it. This is 
            reinforced in my meetings for trips as well as the recognition of "the good, the bad, and the ugly" 
            of each trip.</p>

        <h2>The Logo</h2>
        <p>Well, it's not the right word. I wouldn't call myself a missionary. My role is in service with leadership. 
          There's a no nonsense simplicity to it that can't be misconstrued. You can use a bigger word such as, philanthropist. 
          But I'm not that. Something of a humanitarian. I'd say the best term would be to serve others. That's the root of the
           problem is that there is no one word to describe this job. That's not to say, that the word missionary is inherently 
           bad of course. I like to use the word service. Someone who comes alongside, providing aid to make a difference.</p>

        <h2>Our Future</h2>
        <p>My very first trip was to Mississippi. Four days. We drove through the night, worked for three days, turned around and 
          drove back. Basically helping rebuild a church outside of Jackson, Mississippi. That was 1993. I remember we had a camper,
          and we broke down right in the middle of the Walt Whitman bridge. It was rough. It was hard. That was my first experience, 
          although I didn't lead it. The first trip I lead was to Kentucky in 1996. I was three weeks into the job at Saint Pauls when 
          they said, “we have 26 people to go on the Kentucky trip. You're going to have to lead it.” I never ran a trip before. That's 
          when I started getting a taste of what it could be like to lead young people on mission trips. I realized it was an opportunity
          to influence people in a positive and powerful way, in having to function outside of comfort zones.</p>
