    <h2>Cypress Missions</h2>
    <p>We are recently formed, but our roots run deep. For over 25 years, Freddie has led teams of people
       on work-oriented trips throughout North America. Cypress Missions is devoted to mobilizing short-term 
       mission trips that directly impact the recovery efforts of communities in need following natural disasters. 
       We connect teams and resources to rebuild distressed and impoverished areas. Cypress missions has brought 
       resources, repaired many different structures to bring healthy quality of life back to poverty stricken 
       communities and devastated communities from natural disasters.</p>

        <h2>Outreach</h2>
        <p>It's very simple for me. I don't have a “we and they” mentality. My youth groups were always wide open. When they walked 
          in the doors, there was no doubt they were accepted for who they were but challenged to be more. This same philosophy applies 
          to mission trips. We are no better or worse than those we go to help. You teach compassion and empathy by experiencing it. This 
          is reinforced in my meetings for trips as well as the recognition of "the good, the bad, and the ugly" of each trip.

        <h2>The Logo</h2>
        <p>I've always been drawn to the characteristics of the lone Monterey Cypress. It's long life and "wind-sculpted" shape. This image 
          represents strength, adaptability and stability. It stands firm while withstanding challenges. There's an element of grace as well, 
          the passage in Isaiah; “Cypress trees will grow where now there are briers; myrtle trees will come up in place of thorns. This will 
          be a sign that will last forever, a reminder of what I the Lord, have done."

        <h2>Future Of Cypress</h2>
        <p>The only certainty in the future is uncertainty. My approach is a natural extension of what I know to do, as in a lifestyle. Remaining 
          proactive with some basic principles and integrity. Purpose filled goals, not expectations. A team of long-term strategic thinkers to accomplish 
          the objectives. Although we aim to provide support on a global scale, we don't neglect our own communities. Ultimately, to influence and impact in a 
          lasting way. I've often said people will sometimes believe what we say, but will always believe what we do.
