        <h2>Greater Calling</h2>
        <p>When I was attending college in California, this one student would tell me, "I think my calling
           is to go to Hawaii, to do ministry," I couldn't help but say... really? Hawaii, beautiful place.
           And I'd sit and think, how do you know? People always tell me "I just know God's calling me." Well,
           I don't know... I have no idea. I just know that I'm supposed to help people. That's a calling for 
           Christians and non Christians alike. We're supposed to help people. I just streamlined that into a 
           mentality of.. okay, now what's the best way to use the time I have? Then I started walking through 
           doors. The more the doors opened, the more things became available to me, the more I became aware of 
           the needs. Then I realized, this must be what I'm supposed to do. Mistakes are made along the way, yes, 
           but "calling" is a very generic term, and I'm very careful not to use it. I'm more in tune with, this is 
           what I'm supposed to do.</p>

        <h2>Being a "Missionary"</h2>
        <p>Well, it's not the right word. I wouldn't call myself a missionary. My role is in service with leadership. 
          There's a no nonsense simplicity to it that can't be misconstrued. You can use a bigger word such as, philanthropist. 
          But I'm not that. Something of a humanitarian. I'd say the best term would be to serve others. That's the root of the
           problem is that there is no one word to describe this job. That's not to say, that the word missionary is inherently 
           bad of course. I like to use the word service. Someone who comes alongside, providing aid to make a difference.</p>

        <h2>Early Missions</h2>
        <p>My very first trip was to Mississippi. Four days. We drove through the night, worked for three days, turned around and 
          drove back. Basically helping rebuild a church outside of Jackson, Mississippi. That was 1993. I remember we had a camper,
          and we broke down right in the middle of the Walt Whitman bridge. It was rough. It was hard. That was my first experience, 
          although I didn't lead it. The first trip I lead was to Kentucky in 1996. I was three weeks into the job at Saint Pauls when 
          they said, “we have 26 people to go on the Kentucky trip. You're going to have to lead it.” I never ran a trip before. That's 
          when I started getting a taste of what it could be like to lead young people on mission trips. I realized it was an opportunity
          to influence people in a positive and powerful way, in having to function outside of comfort zones.</p>
